Madam, Sir,

Wikipedia has become a huge scale database storing wide-range of human knowledge, it is a promising corpus for knowledge extraction.

DBpedia (from "DB" for "database") is a project aiming to extract structured content from the information created as part of the Wikipedia project. T

Wikidata is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation: a free, collaborative, multilingual, secondary database, collecting structured data to provide support for Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, the other Wikimedia projects, and well beyond that.

Could you please ask the authors of your journal , once their paper has been accepted, to add  - or to update - an article in wikipedia.
