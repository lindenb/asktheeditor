Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) is
characterized by prenatal-onset distended urinary bladder with functional
intestinal obstruction, requiring extensive surgical intervention for survival.
While it is believed to be an autosomal recessive disorder, most cases are
sporadic. Through whole-exome sequencing in a child with MMIHS, we identified a
de novo mutation, p.R178L, in the gene encoding the smooth muscle gamma-2 actin, 
ACTG2. We subsequently detected another de novo ACTG2 mutation, p.R178C, in an
additional child with MMIHS. Actg2 transcripts were primarily found in murine
urinary bladder and intestinal tissues. Structural analysis and functional
experiments suggested that both ACTG2 mutants interfere with proper
polymerization of ACTG2 into thin filaments, leading to impaired contractility of
the smooth muscle. In conclusion, our study suggests a pathogenic mechanism for
MMIHS by identifying causative ACTG2 mutations.
